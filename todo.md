# Random ToDo:
- maybe add match archive table with uuid, players, match ended at, demo link, json link etc
- make map pool votable before teams are created
- implement BO5 BO3 BO1
- maybe add 1v1, 2v2, 5v5 mode?
- Need to tweak default elo (currently 800 -> maybe a tad lower who knows)

# Bugs:
- weird edge cases where urls are not registered when there is a / behind the url


# Done:
- help command
- proper Error Handling
- rcon commands
- complete match automation
- no more force starting matches


# Important
- [ ] write tutorial
- [x] write readme
- [x] update github
